      <h1>Impact of Footbridges: Evidence from Nicaragua</h1>
      <h2>This project measures the effects of new footbridge construction in rural villages of northwestern Nicaragua by surveying households before and after footbridge construction, and doing equivalent surveys in comparable communities not receiving a footbridge.</h2>

    <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>In 2013, Bridges to Prosperity partnered with economists at the University of Notre Dame to examine the potential of footbridges to create access to local markets, farms, schools, health clinics, and other critical services and opportunities. Lead by and Dr. Kevin Donovan and Dr. Wyatt Brooks, this randomized controlled trial surveyed fifteen communities in rural Nicaragua to compare changes in health, education, and livelihoods following the construction of a footbridge.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>901 households surveyed</li>
      <li>15 communities</li>
      <li>6 footbridges</li>
      <li>3 years of surveys</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The results of this work were extraordinary, and demonstrated the power of a bridge to transform the way people earn income, save, and invest in their future.</p>

    <h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>When considering what a flooded river means for a community without a bridge, we first think of the immediacy of the problem: a flooded river makes it dangerous or impossible to reach jobs, markets, schools, and health centers. At best, it is an inconvenient obstacle, and at worst it is fatal. In either case, it initially seems to be a problem that is wrapped up in the moment of being unable to cross a river to get to where you need to go. One of the most remarkable findings of the study is how bridges change the way people approach risk.</p>

    <p>In the developed world, people rely on transportation infrastructure to get them to where they need to go, regardless of the weather. With few exceptions, rain or snow do not affect their decisions about their education, career, or health. In the rural farmlands of the developing world, rain is both critical to livelihoods and an agent of chaos, causing unpredictable surges in rivers that are unconstrained by flood controls. Far beyond affecting a family’s ability to reach important destinations during the flood itself, the volatility of the river governs major life decisions.

    During periods of flooding in rural Nicaragua, local stores rationed food because of their inability to restock, and people were not able to reach larger farms to work. In fact, researchers found that weather events as banal as heavy rain had far-reaching effects for the communities in the study.</p>

    <p>Bridges ensure consistent access to outside markets, regional farms, and non-agricultural employment opportunities, in addition to secondary schools, clinics, and regional hospitals. Footbridges give people the freedom to invest in their future without concern for the increased risk: they might invest in more in their farms, because they no longer fear being unable to get their goods to market due to a suddenly flooded river, or they may take a non-farm job because they know they’ll be able to get to work even after a heavy rain.</p>

    <p>This study demonstrated that safe connectivity not only affects our behavior on a day-to-day basis, it influences our long-term decision making in subtle ways that have significant effects on our lives.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>During the rainy season, communities without bridges have an average income of 968 cordoba, which has a statistically significant fall to 795 cordoba during floods. Communities with bridges also have average incomes of 968 cordoba without floods, but with floods there is no statistically significant change in their income. </li>
      <li>The likelihood that a household makes no income is 21.8% in communities without bridges, which rises to 33.9% during floods. In communities with bridges, this likelihood is 21.6% and actually falls to 17.6% during floods (marginally significant).</li>
      <li>Likelihood of not being “rationed” on any staple crop (corn, rice or beans), whereby households were not allowed to buy their desired amount of food, is 15.3% in communities without bridges and rises to 48.7% during floods. In communities with bridges, this probability is just 2.1% in non-flooding periods and 0.9% during floods.</li>
      <li>Total number of missed school days averaged 0.18 per household and increased to 0.31 during periods of flooding in communities without bridges. With bridges, this was 0.12 during non-flooding periods and 0.02 with a bridge (the decrease from 0.12 to 0.02 is not statistically significant).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Food Security</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Food security, a family’s ability to reliably access nutritious, affordable food, was another aspect of rural life that was significantly affected by the presence of a footbridge. Prior to bridge construction, the likelihood of a family not being able to purchase enough food doubled during periods of flooding.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Following bridge construction, that effect disappeared. </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Agriculture</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Bridges to Prosperity primarily works with remote communities, where subsistence farming and agricultural work are by far the most common sources of livelihood. In fact, [x]% of the individuals that participated in this research earned at least a portion of their livelihood through agriculture, whether growing food for their own family and selling the surplus at the market, or working as a laborer at a larger farm in the area.</p>
    <p>The effects of a bridge on agriculture were striking, and tell a story aligned with the inherent seasonality of life in rural Nicaragua: bridges mitigate risk and empower families to invest more in their farms, resulting in improved harvests, and a greater proportion of crops available to be sold at the market, rather than saved.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Following the construction of the bridge, spending on agricultural intermediates (such as fertilizer and pesticide) increased by 646 cordoba from an average of 934 cordoba.</li>
      <li>Yields on corn (the primary staple crop) increased by 56%.</li>
      <li>Proportion of harvest stored in the home decreased from 94% to 87%.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Growth and Stability in Income</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Perhaps the most important revelation of the study was the overall effect of a bridge on the growth and stability of household income. In addition to increasing investment and yields for small subsistence farms, bridges made it possible for people to seek and maintain consistent work outside of their community, resulting in significant increases in household income. Communities with a bridge also experienced substantial decreases in debt.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Labor market income increased by 308 cordoba in communities with bridges on a baseline average of 1026 cordoba. This increase was entirely due to increased earning outside of the community.</li>
      <li>Total outstanding debt decreases by 788 cordoba from an average of 1291 cordoba.</li>
      <li>The number of households with any debt decreased from 41.3% to 32.3% (this decrease is not statistically significant).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The results of this work were extraordinary, and demonstrated the power of a bridge to transform the way people earn income, save, and invest in their future.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Occupational Shifts</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>While it wasn’t surprising that many people found non-farm employment outside of the community following the construction of the bridge, it was surprising to learn that some people also shifted from non-farm jobs to farming. Despite the overall decrease in the number of people farming, the amount of land being farmed remained the same, suggesting that agriculture in the communities that received a bridge became more efficient, and that people had opportunities to pursue new occupations that would result it higher and more consistent incomes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Return on Investment</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>On a household level, the effect of a bridge is considerable. On a community level, it is enormous. Considering the direct and in-kind project contributions from Bridges to Prosperity, local governments, and communities, the annual return on investment for a single bridge is nearly $10,000 for a 40-houshold community.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Combining gains in labor income and the value of increased crop yields, the average household in a community with a bridge experienced an estimated 6,325 cordoba increase in annual income. This compares to a household average total income of 20,332 cordoba in communities without bridges.</li>
      <li>Community-level annual return on investment is $9,424.</li>
      <li>Estimated ROI for the lifetime of a bridge is XXXXX.</li>
      <li>Estimated ROI for all B2P bridges in a single year is XXXXX.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Power of a Bridge</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>836 million people live in extreme poverty. The problem is immense, and the resources to address the problem are woefully insufficient. To meet this challenge, we must be ruthlessly strategic about how we invest our resources, both as an organization, and a global community of people committed to ending poverty.</p>
    <p>At Bridges to Prosperity, we are heartened and emboldened by the results of this research. It authenticates the idea on which we were founded: that a single footbridge can create transformative access to opportunity. This work has demonstrated that footbridges are powerful and enduring tools for intervention in the developing world, exceptional in their cost-effectiveness, their return on investment for donors, local governments, and communities, and their ability to quickly and sustainably move the needle on rural poverty.</p>
